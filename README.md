# 2048 game

##### In this project I implemented the classic game 2048. 

Try to play. But be aware that it is addictive!

[PLAY GAME](https://antonina-klishch.github.io/2048_game/)


## Technologies:

* JavaScript (JS)
* SCSS
* HTML
* Document Object Model (DOM)

## Game Logic:

**Moving Tiles**: Tiles can be moved in four directions: up, down, left, and right. Tiles slide until they reach the edge or collide with another tile. When tiles with the same value collide, they merge into one, doubling the value.

**Score**: The game keeps track of the player's score, which increases when tiles are merged.

**Restart**: The game can be restarted by clicking the "RESTART" button. This resets the score and places new tiles on the grid.

**Win/Lose** Conditions: If a tile with a value of 2048 is created, a win message is displayed. If there are no more possible moves, a lose message is displayed.

## Enjoy the game
